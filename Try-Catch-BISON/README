To launch program you need to have GCC installed on your machine and then specify PATH to it in makeit.cmd file.

After compilation process you will receive test.exe file. Launch it and write any "Try-Catch" statement, which is allowed by grammar. 
You can use this example: 
try { throw Exeption_1; throw Exeption_2; print First; try { throw Exeption_3; print Second;} catch (Exeption_3) {print Third;}} catch (Exeption_1) {print Fourth;} catch (Exeption_2) {print Fifth;} 

You will get "DONE" after pressing "Enter" if your statement is correct in terms of grammar. You will get "Syntax Error" if there are errors in your code.

NOTES:
1. It is recommended to use spacing after every lexem;
2. ALWAYS begin names of Exceptions and printable Text with a capital letter. Use test.in for reference
3. Any level of nesting is possible
4. The program does not support semantic
